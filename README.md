# Breast-Cancer-Predication-

Breast cancer is one of top cancer that occurs in a woman. It is the second
main leading reason for the death of a woman in the United States and in Asian
countries. If we identify this disease in early stages there is a better chance for
curing. For this project various algorithm used for finding classification accuracy
and it is implemented on R tool.Breast Cancer Diagnosis is distinguishing of benign
from malignant breast lumps.We consider Wisconsin breast cancer (original)
dataset taken from UCI machine learning repository.

The principal objective in this project is simple, classify a patient in the
groups with diagnosis benign or malign according to values of 32 features
provided by the dataset created by the University of Wisconsin which has 569
instances (rows — samples).

In this project different techniques are used for the prediction of breast
cancer risk and their performance is compared in order to evaluate the best model.
Experimental results shows that the Random Forest is a better model for the
prediction of breast cancer risks. We have found a model based on Random Forest
with good results over the test set. This model has a sensibility of 0.976 with a F1
score of 0.976.
